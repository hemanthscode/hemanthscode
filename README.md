        <h2>📚 My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My fascination with technology began during my undergraduate years, where I was introduced to the limitless potential of software development. The thrill of creating something impactful out of nothing but lines of code ignited a spark that continues to drive me.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my proudest achievements has been developing a user-friendly API and creating a website for <strong>"Soul Craft Society"</strong>, my dream NGO dedicated to making a positive difference. This project combined my passion for technology with my desire to give back to the community.
        </p>
        <h3>🎵 Beyond Code</h3>
        <p>
          When I’m not immersed in coding, I find joy in singing my favorite songs, diving into the world of books, and exploring the latest advancements in technology. These hobbies not only fuel my creativity but also keep me grounded and inspired.
        </p>
        <h3>🌟 Moving Forward</h3>
        <p>
          I believe that technology is a powerful tool for change, and I’m committed to learning, growing, and building solutions that leave a lasting impact. With every project, I strive to bridge the gap between ideas and innovation.
